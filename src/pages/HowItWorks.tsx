            Found someone with a skill you need? Send them a swap proposal.
            Clearly define what skill you will offer in exchange for theirs, the
            scope of work, timeline, and any other important details. You can
            also use the messaging system to discuss before proposing.

            The other user reviews your proposal. They can accept, decline, or
            suggest modifications. Once both parties agree on the terms, the
            swap is initiated. For added security, consider using the Escrow
            service for valuable trades.

            Once both parties are satisfied that the services are completed
            according to the agreement, they confirm completion on the platform.
            You can then leave a review and rating for the other user based on
            your experience. A small swap fee is processed upon successful
            completion.
